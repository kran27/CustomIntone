# CustomIntone
My customized programming font.
Based on [Intel One Mono](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono), [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)-ed, and "Liga" fonts [Ligaturized](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) (with ligatures from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)), other fonts [Ligaturized](https://github.com/gaplo917/Ligatured-Hack) with ligatures from Fira Code and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono), along with one single icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) (the RAM icon, \uf538, added due to a bug in [yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) not using fallbacks right)

### Feel Free to use!
All I did was compile some existing things. The font is licensed under the MIT license but must also follow some portions of OFL. Intel One Mono and Fira Code are under OFL, see [Nerd Fonts' License Audit](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/license-audit.md) for more info.
